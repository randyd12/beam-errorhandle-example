To
use
Beam,
your
driver
program
must
first
create
an
instance
of
the
Beam
SDK
class
Pipeline
(typically
in
the
main()
function).
When
you
create
your
Pipeline,
you’ll
also
need
to
set
some
configuration
options.
You
can
set
your
pipeline’s
configuration
options
programatically,
but
it’s
often
easier
to
set
the
options
ahead
of
time
(or
read
them
from
the
command
line)
and
pass
them
to
the
Pipeline
object
when
you
create
the
object.
